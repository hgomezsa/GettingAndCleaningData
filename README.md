##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

#Description

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

#To keep in mind:

Packages data.table and reshape2 are required to run the script

#Usage

Download and execute run_analysis.R
Input files must be extracted keeping the same path under the same user's home directory that's running R
